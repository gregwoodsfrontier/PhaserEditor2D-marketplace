A demo game based on a Tiled map and sprite animations.

*This game is a version of the [Ansimuz's Sunny Land Forest](https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art).*

This is a typical game made with a Tiled map. The map is imported into a Phaser Editor 2D scene and combined with other prefab instances, like characters and environment images of variable size.
